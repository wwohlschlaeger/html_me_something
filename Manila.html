    <h2><p><a name="The family">Meeting the Family</a></p></h2>
      <p>This was my first trip to The Philippines; and my first time meeting Rose's family.  It was fun to meet them.  They are good, simple people.  My flight got in late so we didn't have time to go out and celebrate much, but we had a lovely time on Christmas together, talking, laughing, and getting to know each other. </p>

    <h2><p><a name="Star City">The Day at Star City</a></p></h2>
      <p>Star City is a very popular amusement park in the metro Manila area.  It has a vast indoor area full of incredible dioramas, roller coasters, and rides.  The larger coasters and rides are in an outdoor area.  The park is crowded everyday and expect long lines to ride any of the rides. </p>

    <h2><p><a name="Manila">Metro Manila</a></p></h2>
      <p>Manila is a large crowded modern city.  There is construction going on everywhere.  What I noticed about Manila is that everywhere you look there are construction cranes set up building new high-rise buildings.  But the main Manila area is similar to a "shanty-town" type area. Most of this can probably be attributed to the fact that the majority of people are poor; and that the climate is mostly warm all year round.</p>

      <p>Tranportation around Manila is "interesting".  There appears to be no public transportation besides taxis.  All of the other transportation is by personal cars, or these mini-buses they call "jeepneys" and "trykes" which are motorcycles equiped with side cars.  There are large buses that transfer people between different towns, but no subway or rail systems. </p>

      <p>Most people in The Philippines have a strong catholic faith.  One of the places we visited was the "Our Lady of The Galapagos Shrine".  It's one of the more popular shrines in the area. </p>
